Providing incredible views of the clouds, mists and greenery around, this Lady’s Seat was once the favourite recreational spots of the British females, residing in Yercaud. <br><br>
                    During the olden days, this rock hosted numerous kitty parties for the British women and was also one of their favourite hangouts for their chit-chats.<br><br>
                    The beauty of this rock magnifies incredibly with the advent of evening. It is during the evening, that Lady’s Seat offers the most spectacular views of the sunset. the place is close to some of the best places to stay in Yercaud.</p>

In order to prove their supremacy over one another, both the gangs lock horns in a top-notch dance competition.

                    One of the edible oil companies located in Parsakhera industrial area of Bareilly has come forward to spread awareness about environmental protection and have contributed virtually to planting trees. <br><br>
                    In wake of World Environment Day, a unique campaign has been launched on Facebook titled as #SeedsofHappiness. Under this initiative, a special environmental protection post has been posted and all social media users
                    have been requested to comment on the post and tag their friends. At the end of campaign on June 10, whatever number of comments would be made on the campaign/post, the same number of trees shall be planted in
                    the city while contributing its bit to the cause of environment protection.<br><br>
                    The 10-day campaign is being carried out to commemorate Environment Day which is being celebrated across the world on June 5. Additionally, several activities related to environment are also the part of the event. Ghanshyam Khandelwal, chief managing director of the edible company says, "We have taken this initiative of planting saplings to improve the environment of our region and seek support from all strata of the society to make it successful. However, our goal is to earn at least 10,000 comments on Facebook by June 10, so that plantation of 10,000 trees could be done. We expect people to come forward as responsible citizens to contribute their bit in the wake of social improvement and environmental protection."
